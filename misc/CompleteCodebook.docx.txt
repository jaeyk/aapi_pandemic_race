Thank you for participating in this study. The goal of this study is to measure how stereotypes such as the model minority and forever foreigner affect Asian American’s views on their racial group. You may have read one of two articles that stated that companies prefer to hire Asian Americans because of their academic ability or you read an article that stated that companies did not prefer to hire Asian Americans due to beliefs about their English speaking ability. Both of these articles are false and made up for the purposes of this study. The deception is necessary because the articles are designed to mimic a ‘casual microaggression’ that Asian Americans may receive in day to day media. You’ll note that both of these articles do not explicitly seem ‘racial’ or ‘racist’ yet the underlying sentiment is couched in beliefs that Asian Americans are a ‘model minority’, well-educated, hardworking, and quiet. The other article is couched in the belief that Asian Americans are ‘forever foreigners’, unable or unwilling to assimilate into mainstream American society, hence the inability to speak English. Your time and participation in this study is extremely valuable, as Asian American political experiences are understudied. Thank you for taking the time to participate in this survey.

W3_39 We would like you to rate the following individuals using something we call the feeling thermometer. Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel favorable and warm toward the group. Ratings between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel favorable toward the group and that you don't care too much for the group. You would rate at the 50 degree mark if you don't feel particularly warm or cold toward the group.
